While some pieces of the puzzle are given one can not see the full picture without the missing ones. Hence the focus of this work is to shed light onto the topic with a straightforward and clean approach based on examples and answering many whys along the way so that more individuals can appreciate the state of the art technology, its innovators and ultimately the beauty of math. Paper's contribution is a simplistic exposition with a sufficient and gradually increasing level of complexity, necessary to understand zk-SNARK without any prerequisite knowledge of the subject, cryptography or advanced math. The primary goal is not only to explain how it works but why it works and how it came to be this way.",Maksym Petkus

Statistical decision theory requires more causality: Rational decisions are actions taken to minimize costs while maximizing benefits, and thus require explication of causes of loss and gain. Competent statistical practice thus integrates logic, context, and probability into scientific inference and decision using narratives filled with causality. This reality was seen and accounted for intuitively by the founders of modern statistics, but was not well recognized in the ensuing statistical theory (which focused instead on the causally inert properties of probability measures). Nonetheless, both statistical foundations and basic statistics can and should be taught using formal causal models. The causal view of statistical science fits within a broader information-processing framework which illuminates and unifies frequentist, Bayesian, and related probability-based foundations of statistics. Causality theory can thus be seen as a key component connecting computation to contextual information, not extra-statistical but instead essential for sound statistical training and applications.",Sander Greenland

To improve dynamical seasonal forecast, it is crucial to set up forecast benchmarks, and clarify forecast limitations posed by model initialization errors, formulation deficiencies, and internal climate variability. With huge cost in generating large forecast ensembles, and limited observations for forecast verification, the seasonal forecast benchmarking and diagnosing task proves challenging. In this study, we develop a probabilistic deep neural network model, drawing on a wealth of existing climate simulations to enhance seasonal forecast capability and forecast diagnosis. By leveraging complex physical relationships encoded in climate simulations, our probabilistic forecast model demonstrates favorable deterministic and probabilistic skill compared to state-of-the-art dynamical forecast systems in quasi-global seasonal forecast of precipitation and near-surface temperature. We apply this probabilistic forecast methodology to quantify the impacts of initialization errors and model formulation deficiencies in a dynamical seasonal forecasting system. We introduce the saliency analysis approach to efficiently identify the key predictors that influence seasonal variability. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling uncertainty using variational Bayes, we give a more definitive answer to how the El Nino/Southern Oscillation, the dominant mode of seasonal variability, modulates global seasonal predictability.","Baoxiang Pan, Gemma J.

However, many popular methods for unsupervised inference of latent dynamics from experimental data implicitly assume that the measurements have higher intrinsic dimensionality than the underlying system---making coordinate identification a dimensionality reduction problem. Here, we study the opposite limit, in which hidden governing coordinates must be inferred from only a low-dimensional time series of measurements. Inspired by classical analysis techniques for partial observations of chaotic attractors, we introduce a general embedding technique for univariate and multivariate time series, consisting of an autoencoder trained with a novel latent-space loss function. We show that our technique reconstructs the strange attractors of synthetic and real-world systems better than existing techniques, and that it creates consistent, predictive representations of even stochastic systems. We conclude by using our technique to discover dynamical attractors in diverse systems such as patient electrocardiograms, household electricity usage, neural spiking, and eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser---demonstrating diverse applications of our technique for exploratory data analysis.",William Gilpin

This is greatly attributed to the robustness topological representations provide against different types of physical nuisance variables seen in real-world data, such as view-point, illumination, and more. However, key bottlenecks to their large scale adoption are computational expenditure and difficulty incorporating them in a differentiable architecture. We take an important step in this paper to mitigate these bottlenecks by proposing a novel one-step approach to generate PIs directly from the input data. We design two separate convolutional neural network architectures, one designed to take in multi-variate time series signals as input and another that accepts multi-channel images as input. We call these networks Signal PI-Net and Image PI-Net respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose the use of deep learning for computing topological features directly from data. We explore the use of the proposed PI-Net architectures on two applications: human activity recognition using tri-axial accelerometer sensor data and image classification. We demonstrate the ease of fusion of PIs in supervised deep learning architectures and speed up of several orders of magnitude for extracting PIs from data.

We explore this problem in the context of cellular automata (CA), simple dynamical systems that are intrinsically discrete and thus difficult to analyze using standard tools from dynamical systems theory. We show that any CA may readily be represented using a convolutional neural network with a network-in-network architecture. This motivates our development of a general convolutional multilayer perceptron architecture, which we find can learn the dynamical rules for arbitrary CA when given videos of the CA as training data. In the limit of large network widths, we find that training dynamics are nearly identical across replicates, and that common patterns emerge in the structure of networks trained on different CA rulesets. We train ensembles of networks on randomly-sampled CA, and we probe how the trained networks internally represent the CA rules using an information-theoretic technique based on distributions of layer activation patterns. We find that CA with simpler rule tables produce trained networks with hierarchical structure and layer specialization, while more complex CA produce shallower representations---illustrating how the underlying complexity of the CA's rules influences the specificity of these internal representations. Our results suggest how the entropy of a physical process can affect its representation when learned by neural networks.",William Gilpin

Among these applications, neural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view synthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamental obstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and memory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along the rendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate those integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic integration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to integrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate the computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. The graph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble the graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite integral in two evaluations of the network. Applying this approach to neural rendering, we improve a tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality: improving render times by greater than 10 times with a tradeoff of slightly reduced image quality.","David B.

This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI.   The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between ""hand-engineering"" and ""end-to-end"" learning, and instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.","Peter W. Battaglia, Jessica B.

Equivariant networks have shown excellent performance and data efficiency on vision and medical imaging problems that exhibit symmetries. Here we show how this principle can be extended beyond global symmetries to local gauge transformations. This enables the development of a very general class of convolutional neural networks on manifolds that depend only on the intrinsic geometry, and which includes many popular methods from equivariant and geometric deep learning. We implement gauge equivariant CNNs for signals defined on the surface of the icosahedron, which provides a reasonable approximation of the sphere. By choosing to work with this very regular manifold, we are able to implement the gauge equivariant convolution using a single conv2d call, making it a highly scalable and practical alternative to Spherical CNNs. Using this method, we demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods on the task of segmenting omnidirectional images and global climate patterns.","Taco S.

This paper extends several results known for constant-weight G3Ms to the general case of G3Ms with time-varying and potentially stochastic weights. These results include the returns and no-arbitrage prices of liquidity pool (LP) shares that investors receive for supplying liquidity to G3Ms. Using these expressions, we show how to create G3Ms whose LP shares replicate the payoffs of financial derivatives. The resulting hedges are model-independent and exact for derivative contracts whose payoff functions satisfy an elasticity constraint. These strategies allow LP shares to replicate various trading strategies and financial contracts, including standard options. G3Ms are thus shown to be capable of recreating a variety of active trading strategies through passive positions in LP shares.",Alex Evans

Curvature and market making,"Liquidity and trading activity on constant function market makers (CFMMs) such as Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer has grown significantly in the second half of 2020. Much of the growth of these protocols has been driven by incentivized pools or 'yield farming', which reward participants in crypto assets for providing liquidity to CFMMs. As a result, CFMMs and associated protocols, which were historically very small markets, now constitute the most liquid trading venues for a large number of crypto assets. But what does it mean for a CFMM to be the most liquid market? In this paper, we propose a basic definition of price sensitivity and liquidity. We show that this definition is tightly related to the curvature of a CFMM's trading function and can be used to explain a number of heuristic results. For example, we show that low-curvature markets are good for coins whose market value is approximately fixed and that high-curvature markets are better for liquidity providers when traders have an informational edge. Additionally, the results can also be used to model interacting markets and explain the rise of incentivized liquidity provision, also known as 'yield farming.'","Guillermo Angeris, Alex Evans, Tarun Chitra"

Recently, it has been shown that models identified by dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) on time-delay coordinates provide linear representations of strongly nonlinear systems, in the so-called Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) approach. Curiously, the resulting linear model has a matrix representation that is approximately antisymmetric and tridiagonal with a zero diagonal; for chaotic systems, there is an additional forcing term in the last component. In this paper, we establish a new theoretical connection between HAVOK and the Frenet-Serret frame from differential geometry, and also develop an improved algorithm to identify more stable and accurate models from less data. In particular, we show that the sub- and super-diagonal entries of the linear model correspond to the intrinsic curvatures in Frenet-Serret frame. Based on this connection, we modify the algorithm to promote this antisymmetric structure, even in the noisy, low-data limit. We demonstrate this improved modeling procedure on data from several nonlinear synthetic and real-world examples.","Seth M. Hirsh, Sara M. Ichinaga, Steven L. Brunton, J. Nathan Kutz, Bingni W.

GANs can produce realistic images, but they suffer from mode collapse and do not provide simple ways to get the latent representation of an image. On the other hand, VAEs do not have these problems, but they often generate images less realistic than GANs. In this article, we explain that this lack of realism is partially due to a common underestimation of the natural image manifold dimensionality. To solve this issue we introduce a new framework that combines VAE and GAN in a novel and complementary way to produce an auto-encoding model that keeps VAEs properties while generating images of GAN-quality.

These interactions give rise to complex and higher-order system behaviors, and are encoded using data as the network's edges. However, distinguishing between true weak edges and low-weight edges caused by noise remains a challenge. We address this problem by examining the higher-order structure of noisy, weak edges added to model networks. We find that the structure of low-weight, noisy edges varies according to the topology of the model network to which it is added. By investigating this variation more closely, we see that at least three qualitative classes of noise structure emerge. Furthermore, we observe that the structure of noisy edges contains enough model-specific information to classify the model networks with moderate accuracy. Finally, we offer network generation rules that can drive different types of structure in added noisy edges. Our results demonstrate that noise does not present as a monolithic nuisance, but rather as a nuanced, topology-dependent, and even useful entity in characterizing higher-order network interactions. Hence, we provide an alternate approach to noise management by embracing its role in such interactions.","Ann S. Blevins, Jason Z. Kim, Danielle S. Bassett"

WedgeChain tackles these challenges by the following proposals: (1) Lazy (asynchronous) certification: where data is committed at the untrusted edge and then lazily certified at the cloud node. This lazy certification method takes advantage of the observation that an untrusted edge node is unlikely to act maliciously if it knows it will be detected (and punished) eventually. Our lazy certification method guarantees that malicious acts (i.e., lying) are eventually detected. (2) Data-free certification: our lazy certification method only needs to send digests of data to the cloud, instead of sending all data to the cloud, which enables saving network and cloud resources and reduce costs.

Numerous methods for improving capital efficiency have been proposed that allow stakers to create fungible derivative claims on their staked assets. In this paper, we construct a unifying model for studying the security risks of these proposals. This model combines birth-death P\'olya processes and risk models adapted from the credit derivatives literature to assess token inequality and return profiles. We find that there is a sharp transition between 'safe' and 'unsafe' derivative usage.

We quantify the probability of an adversarial trader being able to undertake the attack, based on the relative positioning of a transaction within a blockchain block. We find that a single adversarial trader can earn a daily revenue of over several thousand USD when performing sandwich attacks on one particular DEX -- Uniswap, an exchange with over 5M USD daily trading volume by June 2020. In addition to a single-adversary game, we simulate the outcome of sandwich attacks under multiple competing adversaries, to account for the real-world trading environment.","Liyi Zhou, Kaihua Qin, Christof Ferreira Torres, Duc V Le, Arthur Gervais"

However, it is not applicable to a number of important continuous distributions. We introduce an alternative approach to computing reparameterization gradients based on implicit differentiation and demonstrate its broader applicability by applying it to Gamma, Beta, Dirichlet, and von Mises distributions, which cannot be used with the classic reparameterization trick.

Geometric Arbitrage and Spectral Theory,"Geometric Arbitrage Theory reformulates a generic asset model possibly allowing for arbitrage by packaging all assets and their forwards dynamics into a stochastic principal fibre bundle, with a connection whose parallel transport encodes discounting and portfolio rebalancing, and whose curvature measures, in this geometric language, the 'instantaneous arbitrage capability' generated by the market itself. The cashflow bundle is the vector bundle associated to this stochastic principal fibre bundle for the natural choice of the vector space fibre. The cashflow bundle carries a stochastic covariant differentiation induced by the connection on the principal fibre bundle. The link between arbitrage theory and spectral theory of the connection Laplacian on the vector bundle is given by the zero eigenspace resulting in a parametrization of all risk neutral measures equivalent to the statistical one. This indicates that a market satisfies the (NFLVR) condition if and only if $0$ is in the discrete spectrum of the connection Laplacian on the cash flow bundle or of the Dirac Laplacian of the twisted cash flow bundle with the exterior algebra bundle. We apply this result by extending Jarrow-Protter-Shimbo theory of asset bubbles for complete arbitrage free markets to markets not satisfying the (NFLVR). Moreover, by means of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, we prove that the Euler characteristic of the asset nominal space is a topological obstruction to the the (NFLVR) condition, and, by means of the Bochner-Weitzenb\""ock formula, the non vanishing of the homology group of the cash flow bundle is revealed to be a topological obstruction to (NFLVR), too. Asset bubbles are defined, classified and decomposed for markets allowing arbitrage.","Simone Farinelli, Hideyuki Takada"

Following Floer, the proof relies on constructing a homology group associated to each such flow, and comparing it with the homology of the ambient symplectic manifold. The proof does not proceed by constructing a version of Floer's complex with characteristic $p$ coefficients, but uses instead the canonical (stable) complex orientations of moduli spaces of Floer trajectories to construct a version of Floer homology with coefficients in Morava's $K$-theories, and can thus be seen as an implementation of Cohen, Jones, and Segal's vision for a Floer homotopy theory. The key feature of Morava K-theory that allows the construction to be carried out is the fact that the corresponding homology and cohomology groups of classifying spaces of finite groups satisfy Poincar\'e duality.","Mohammed Abouzaid, Andrew J.

However, graphs alone cannot capture the multi-level interactions present in many complex systems and the expressive power of such schemes was proven to be limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message Passing Simplicial Networks (MPSNs), a class of models that perform message passing on simplicial complexes (SCs). To theoretically analyse the expressivity of our model we introduce a Simplicial Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) colouring procedure for distinguishing non-isomorphic SCs. We relate the power of SWL to the problem of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs and show that SWL and MPSNs are strictly more powerful than the WL test and not less powerful than the 3-WL test. We deepen the analysis by comparing our model with traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) with ReLU activations in terms of the number of linear regions of the functions they can represent. We empirically support our theoretical claims by showing that MPSNs can distinguish challenging strongly regular graphs for which GNNs fail and, when equipped with orientation equivariant layers, they can improve classification accuracy in oriented SCs compared to a GNN baseline.","Cristian Bodnar, Fabrizio Frasca, Yu Guang Wang, Nina Otter, Guido Montúfar, Pietro Liò, Michael Bronstein"

We are given data indicating that some pairs of items are similar, and optionally, some other pairs are dissimilar. For pairs of similar items, we want the corresponding vectors to be near each other, and for dissimilar pairs, we want the corresponding vectors to not be near each other, measured in Euclidean distance. We formalize this by introducing distortion functions, defined for some pairs of the items. Our goal is to choose an embedding that minimizes the total distortion, subject to the constraints. We call this the minimum-distortion embedding (MDE) problem.   The MDE framework is simple but general. It includes a wide variety of embedding methods, such as spectral embedding, principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, dimensionality reduction methods (like Isomap and UMAP), force-directed layout, and others.

Deep learning is particularly well-suited to structured modeling of heterogeneity in economics.

A major complication in comparison to flat spaces is that it is unclear in which alignment a convolution kernel should be applied on a manifold. The underlying reason for this ambiguity is that general manifolds do not come with a canonical choice of reference frames (gauge). Kernels and features therefore have to be expressed relative to arbitrary coordinates. We argue that the particular choice of coordinatization should not affect a network's inference -- it should be coordinate independent. A simultaneous demand for coordinate independence and weight sharing is shown to result in a requirement on the network to be equivariant under local gauge transformations (changes of local reference frames). The ambiguity of reference frames depends thereby on the G-structure of the manifold, such that the necessary level of gauge equivariance is prescribed by the corresponding structure group G. Coordinate independent convolutions are proven to be equivariant w.r.t. those isometries that are symmetries of the G-structure. The resulting theory is formulated in a coordinate free fashion in terms of fiber bundles. To exemplify the design of coordinate independent convolutions, we implement a convolutional network on the M\""obius strip. The generality of our differential geometric formulation of convolutional networks is demonstrated by an extensive literature review which explains a large number of Euclidean CNNs, spherical CNNs and CNNs on general surfaces as specific instances of coordinate independent convolutions.","Maurice Weiler, Patrick Forré, Erik Verlinde, Max Welling"

Convexity of a smooth set or a function in a Euclidean space is defined by how it interacts with the standard differential structure in this space -- the Hessian of a convex function has to be positive semi-definite everywhere. However, in recent years, there is a growing demand to understand non-convexity and develop computational methods to optimize non-convex functions. Intriguingly, there is a type of non-convexity that disappears once one introduces a suitable differentiable structure and redefines convexity with respect to the straight lines, or {\em geodesics}, with respect to this structure. Such convexity is referred to as {\em geodesic convexity}. Interest in studying it arises due to recent reformulations of some non-convex problems as geodesically convex optimization problems over geodesically convex sets. Geodesics on manifolds have been extensively studied in various branches of Mathematics and Physics. However, unlike convex optimization, understanding geodesics and geodesic convexity from a computational point of view largely remains a mystery. The goal of this exposition is to introduce the first part of geodesic convex optimization -- geodesic convexity -- in a self-contained manner. We first present a variety of notions from differential and Riemannian geometry such as differentiation on manifolds, geodesics, and then introduce geodesic convexity.

We show that in the low-data regime $N<D$, the Gram matrix can be decomposed in a manner that reduces the cost of inference to $\mathcal{O}(N^2D + (N^2)^3)$ (i.e., linear in the number of dimensions) and, in special cases, to $\mathcal{O}(N^2D + N^3)$. This reduction in complexity opens up new use-cases for inference with gradients especially in the high-dimensional regime, where the information-to-cost ratio of gradient observations significantly increases. We demonstrate this potential in a variety of tasks relevant for machine learning, such as optimization and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with predictive gradients.","Filip de Roos, Alexandra Gessner, Philipp Hennig"

It is well-known that the classical superluminal soliton spacetimes require negative energy densities, likely sourced by quantum processes of the uncertainty principle. It has even been claimed by few that negative energy densities are a requirement of superluminal motion. However, recent studies suggest this may not be the case. A general decomposition of the defining variables and the corresponding decomposition of the Eulerian energy are studied. A geometrical interpretation of the Eulerian energy is found, shedding new light on superluminal solitons generated by realistic energy distributions. With this new interpretation, it becomes a relatively simple matter to generate solitonic configurations, within a certain subclass, that respect the positive energy constraint. Using this newfound interpretation, a superluminal solitonic spacetime is presented that possesses positive semi-definite energy. A modest numerical analysis is carried out on a set of example configurations, finding total energy requirements four orders of magnitude smaller than the solar mass. Extraordinarily, the example configurations are generated by purely positive energy densities, a tremendous improvement on the classical configurations. The geometrical interpretation of the Eulerian energy thus opens new doors to generating realistic warp fields for laboratory study and potential future manned interstellar travel.","Shaun D. B.

Proceeding with an examination of AMM market microstructure, we show how non-linear price effect translates into slippage for traders and impermanent losses for liquidity providers.

Decentralized exchange protocols such as Uniswap, Curve and other types of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) maintain a liquidity pool (LP) of two or more assets constrained to maintain at all times a mathematical relation to each other, defined by a given function or curve. Examples of such functions are the constant-sum and constant-product AMMs. Existing systems however suffer from several challenges. They require external arbitrageurs to restore the price of tokens in the pool to match the market price. Such activities can potentially drain resources from the liquidity pool. In particular, dramatic market price changes can result in low liquidity with respect to one or more of the assets and reduce the total value of the LP. We propose in this work a new approach to constructing the AMM by proposing the idea of dynamic curves. It utilizes input from a market price oracle to modify the mathematical relationship between the assets so that the pool price continuously and automatically adjusts to be identical to the market price. This approach eliminates arbitrage opportunities and, as we show through simulations, maintains liquidity in the LP for all assets and the total value of the LP over a wide range of market prices.","Bhaskar Krishnamachari, Qi Feng, Eugenio Grippo"

These problems can be attributed to the strong coupling between the computational graph and the input graph structure. The recently proposed Message Passing Simplicial Networks naturally decouple these elements by performing message passing on the clique complex of the graph. Nevertheless, these models can be severely constrained by the rigid combinatorial structure of Simplicial Complexes (SCs). In this work, we extend recent theoretical results on SCs to regular Cell Complexes, topological objects that flexibly subsume SCs and graphs. We show that this generalisation provides a powerful set of graph ""lifting"" transformations, each leading to a unique hierarchical message passing procedure. The resulting methods, which we collectively call CW Networks (CWNs), are strictly more powerful than the WL test and not less powerful than the 3-WL test. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of one such scheme, based on rings, when applied to molecular graph problems. The proposed architecture benefits from provably larger expressivity than commonly used GNNs, principled modelling of higher-order signals and from compressing the distances between nodes.

Advances in artificial neural networks alongside corresponding advances in hardware accelerators with large memory capacity, together with the availability of large datasets enabled practitioners to train and deploy sophisticated neural network models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks across several fields spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. However, as these neural networks become bigger, more complex, and more widely used, fundamental problems with current deep learning models become more apparent. State-of-the-art deep learning models are known to suffer from issues that range from poor robustness, inability to adapt to novel task settings, to requiring rigid and inflexible configuration assumptions. Collective behavior, commonly observed in nature, tends to produce systems that are robust, adaptable, and have less rigid assumptions about the environment configuration. Collective intelligence, as a field, studies the group intelligence that emerges from the interactions of many individuals. Within this field, ideas such as self-organization, emergent behavior, swarm optimization, and cellular automata were developed to model and explain complex systems. It is therefore natural to see these ideas incorporated into newer deep learning methods. In this review, we will provide a historical context of neural network research's involvement with complex systems, and highlight several active areas in modern deep learning research that incorporate the principles of collective intelligence to advance its current capabilities.

Unfortunately, it was shown that these architectures are limited in their expressive power. This paper proposes a novel framework called Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Networks (ESAN) to address this issue. Our main observation is that while two graphs may not be distinguishable by an MPNN, they often contain distinguishable subgraphs. Thus, we propose to represent each graph as a set of subgraphs derived by some predefined policy, and to process it using a suitable equivariant architecture. We develop novel variants of the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test for graph isomorphism, and prove lower bounds on the expressiveness of ESAN in terms of these new WL variants. We further prove that our approach increases the expressive power of both MPNNs and more expressive architectures. Moreover, we provide theoretical results that describe how design choices such as the subgraph selection policy and equivariant neural architecture affect our architecture's expressive power. To deal with the increased computational cost, we propose a subgraph sampling scheme, which can be viewed as a stochastic version of our framework. A comprehensive set of experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our framework improves the expressive power and overall performance of popular GNN architectures.","Beatrice Bevilacqua, Fabrizio Frasca, Derek Lim, Balasubramaniam Srinivasan, Chen Cai, Gopinath Balamurugan, Michael M.

One is based on the Fisher information metric, which is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which reflects the structure of the distance between random variables. Here, we propose a new information-geometrical theory that is a unified framework connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We primarily considered a discrete case consisting of $n$ elements and studied the geometry of the probability simplex $S_{n-1}$, which is the set of all probability distributions over $n$ elements. The Wasserstein distance was introduced in $S_{n-1}$ by the optimal transportation of commodities from distribution ${\mathbf{p}}$ to distribution ${\mathbf{q}}$, where ${\mathbf{p}}$, ${\mathbf{q}} \in S_{n-1}$. We relaxed the optimal transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The entropy-relaxed optimal cost $C({\mathbf{p}}, {\mathbf{q}})$ was computationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but does not define a distance because it is not minimized at ${\mathbf{p}}={\mathbf{q}}$. To define a proper divergence while retaining the computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the manifold $S_{n-1} \times S_{n-1}$ of optimal transportation plans. We fully explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation plans and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in $S_{n-1}$ that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the KL-divergence.","Shun-ichi Amari, Ryo Karakida, Masafumi Oizumi"

Current extensions of existing (Euclidean) generative models are restricted to specific geometries and typically suffer from high computational costs. We introduce Moser Flow (MF), a new class of generative models within the family of continuous normalizing flows (CNF). MF also produces a CNF via a solution to the change-of-variable formula, however differently from other CNF methods, its model (learned) density is parameterized as the source (prior) density minus the divergence of a neural network (NN). The divergence is a local, linear differential operator, easy to approximate and calculate on manifolds. Therefore, unlike other CNFs, MF does not require invoking or backpropagating through an ODE solver during training. Furthermore, representing the model density explicitly as the divergence of a NN rather than as a solution of an ODE facilitates learning high fidelity densities. Theoretically, we prove that MF constitutes a universal density approximator under suitable assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate for the first time the use of flow models for sampling from general curved surfaces and achieve significant improvements in density estimation, sample quality, and training complexity over existing CNFs on challenging synthetic geometries and real-world benchmarks from the earth and climate sciences.","Noam Rozen, Aditya Grover, Maximilian Nickel, Yaron Lipman"

In this work, we present Hidden Agenda, a two-team social deduction game that provides a 2D environment for studying learning agents in scenarios of unknown team alignment. The environment admits a rich set of strategies for both teams.

In many real-world applications, however, features are only partially available; for example, in social networks, age and gender are available only for a small subset of users. We present a general approach for handling missing features in graph machine learning applications that is based on minimization of the Dirichlet energy and leads to a diffusion-type differential equation on the graph. The discretization of this equation produces a simple, fast and scalable algorithm which we call Feature Propagation. We experimentally show that the proposed approach outperforms previous methods on seven common node-classification benchmarks and can withstand surprisingly high rates of missing features: on average we observe only around 4% relative accuracy drop when 99% of the features are missing. Moreover, it takes only 10 seconds to run on a graph with $\sim$2.5M nodes and $\sim$123M edges on a single GPU.","Emanuele Rossi, Henry Kenlay, Maria I.

This hybrid approach allows PINO to overcome the limitations of purely data-driven and physics-based methods. For instance, data-driven methods fail to learn when data is of limited quantity and/or quality, and physics-based approaches fail to optimize on challenging PDE constraints. By combining both data and PDE constraints, PINO overcomes all these challenges. Additionally, a unique property that PINO enjoys over other hybrid learning methods is its ability to incorporate data and PDE constraints at different resolutions. This allows us to combine coarse-resolution data, which is inexpensive to obtain from numerical solvers, with higher resolution PDE constraints, and the resulting PINO has no degradation in accuracy even on high-resolution test instances. This discretization-invariance property in PINO is due to neural-operator framework which learns mappings between function spaces and allows evaluation at different resolutions without the need for re-training. Moreover, PINO succeeds in the purely physics setting, where no data is available, while other approaches such as the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) fail due to optimization challenges, e.g. in multi-scale dynamic systems such as Kolmogorov flows. This is because PINO learns the solution operator by optimizing PDE constraints on multiple instances while PINN optimizes PDE constraints of a single PDE instance. Further, in PINO, we incorporate the Fourier neural operator (FNO) architecture which achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over numerical solvers and also allows us to compute explicit gradients on function spaces efficiently.","Zongyi Li, Hongkai Zheng, Nikola Kovachki, David Jin, Haoxuan Chen, Burigede Liu, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Anima Anandkumar"

Conformal prediction is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous uncertainty sets/intervals for the predictions of such models. Critically, the sets are valid in a distribution-free sense: they possess explicit, non-asymptotic guarantees even without distributional assumptions or model assumptions. One can use conformal prediction with any pre-trained model, such as a neural network, to produce sets that are guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. It is easy-to-understand, easy-to-use, and general, applying naturally to problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on.

Traditional forecasting models rely on rolling averages, vector auto-regression and auto-regressive integrated moving averages. On the other hand, deep learning and matrix factorization models have been recently proposed to tackle the same problem with more competitive performance. However, one major drawback of such models is that they tend to be overly complex in comparison to traditional techniques. In this paper, we report the results of prominent deep learning models with respect to a well-known machine learning baseline, a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) model. Similar to the deep neural network (DNN) models, we transform the time series forecasting task into a window-based regression problem. Furthermore, we feature-engineered the input and output structure of the GBRT model, such that, for each training window, the target values are concatenated with external features, and then flattened to form one input instance for a multi-output GBRT model. We conducted a comparative study on nine datasets for eight state-of-the-art deep-learning models that were presented at top-level conferences in the last years. The results demonstrate that the window-based input transformation boosts the performance of a simple GBRT model to levels that outperform all state-of-the-art DNN models evaluated in this paper.","Shereen Elsayed, Daniela Thyssens, Ahmed Rashed, Hadi Samer Jomaa, Lars Schmidt-Thieme"

This allows us to verify our implementations by comparing our images of cohomology fractals to existing pictures of Cannon-Thurston maps.   In a sequence of experiments, we explore the limiting behaviour of cohomology fractals as the visual radius increases. Motivated by these experiments, we prove that the values of the cohomology fractals are normally distributed, but with diverging standard deviations.

Instead, we show that the limit is a distribution on the sphere at infinity, only depending on the manifold and cohomology class.","David Bachman, Matthias Goerner, Saul Schleimer, Henry Segerman"

We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate ""backdoor key"", the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees.   First, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature schemes. The construction guarantees that given black-box access to the original model and the backdoored version, it is computationally infeasible to find even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the backdoored model has generalization error comparable with the original model. Second, we demonstrate how to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained using the Random Fourier Features (RFF) learning paradigm or in Random ReLU networks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful white-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the training data, no efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is ""clean"" or contains a backdoor.   Our construction of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related issue of robustness to adversarial examples. In particular, our construction can produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an ""adversarially robust"" classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In summary, the existence of undetectable backdoors represent a significant theoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial robustness.","Shafi Goldwasser, Michael P.

The complex nature of system dynamics within networked economies has rendered it difficult to reason about the growth and evolution of these networks. This paper drew concepts from differential games, classical control engineering, and stochastic dynamical system to come up with a framework and example to model, simulate, and engineer networked token economies. A model on a generalized token economy is proposed where miners provide service to a platform in exchange for a cryptocurrency and users consume service from the platform. Simulations of this model allow us to observe outcomes of complex dynamics and reason about the evolution of the system. Speculative price movements and engineered block rewards were then experimented to observe their impact on system dynamics and network-level goals.

Can there be only one? Following up on the AD systems developed in the JAX and Dex projects, we formalize a decomposition of reverse-mode AD into (i) forward-mode AD followed by (ii) unzipping the linear and non-linear parts and then (iii) transposition of the linear part.   To that end, we define a (substructurally) linear type system that can prove a class of functions are (algebraically) linear. Our main results are that forward-mode AD produces such linear functions, and that we can unzip and transpose any such linear function, conserving cost, size, and linearity. Composing these three transformations recovers reverse-mode AD. This decomposition also sheds light on checkpointing, which emerges naturally from a free choice in unzipping `let` expressions. As a corollary, checkpointing techniques are applicable to general-purpose partial evaluation, not just AD.   We hope that our formalization will lead to a deeper understanding of automatic differentiation and that it will simplify implementations, by separating the concerns of differentiation proper from the concerns of gaining efficiency (namely, separating the derivative computation from the act of running it backward).","Alexey Radul, Adam Paszke, Roy Frostig, Matthew Johnson, Dougal Maclaurin"

Recent work has shown that neural networks can learn such symmetries directly from data using Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs). But HNNs struggle when trained on datasets where energy is not conserved. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to identify and decompose conservative and dissipative dynamics simultaneously. We propose Dissipative Hamiltonian Neural Networks (D-HNNs), which parameterize both a Hamiltonian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Taken together, they represent an implicit Helmholtz decomposition which can separate dissipative effects such as friction from symmetries such as conservation of energy. We train our model to decompose a damped mass-spring system into its friction and inertial terms and then show that this decomposition can be used to predict dynamics for unseen friction coefficients. Then we apply our model to real world data including a large, noisy ocean current dataset where decomposing the velocity field yields useful scientific insights.","Andrew Sosanya, Sam Greydanus"

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.","Ricky T. Q.

In this paper, we propose Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), which can parameterize arbitrary Lagrangians using neural networks. In contrast to models that learn Hamiltonians, LNNs do not require canonical coordinates, and thus perform well in situations where canonical momenta are unknown or difficult to compute. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not restrict the functional form of learned energies and will produce energy-conserving models for a variety of tasks. We test our approach on a double pendulum and a relativistic particle, demonstrating energy conservation where a baseline approach incurs dissipation and modeling relativity without canonical coordinates where a Hamiltonian approach fails. Finally, we show how this model can be applied to graphs and continuous systems using a Lagrangian Graph Network, and demonstrate it on the 1D wave equation.","Miles Cranmer, Sam Greydanus, Stephan Hoyer, Peter Battaglia, David Spergel, Shirley Ho"

Here we demonstrate how graph neural networks can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Our approach is broadly applicable to canonical NP-hard problems in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, such as maximum cut, minimum vertex cover, maximum independent set, as well as Ising spin glasses and higher-order generalizations thereof in the form of polynomial unconstrained binary optimization problems. We apply a relaxation strategy to the problem Hamiltonian to generate a differentiable loss function with which we train the graph neural network and apply a simple projection to integer variables once the unsupervised training process has completed. We showcase our approach with numerical results for the canonical maximum cut and maximum independent set problems.

This universal approximation theorem is suggestive of the potential application of neural networks in learning nonlinear operators from data. However, the theorem guarantees only a small approximation error for a sufficient large network, and does not consider the important optimization and generalization errors. To realize this theorem in practice, we propose deep operator networks (DeepONets) to learn operators accurately and efficiently from a relatively small dataset. A DeepONet consists of two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of sensors $x_i, i=1,\dots,m$ (branch net), and another for encoding the locations for the output functions (trunk net). We perform systematic simulations for identifying two types of operators, i.e., dynamic systems and partial differential equations, and demonstrate that DeepONet significantly reduces the generalization error compared to the fully-connected networks. We also derive theoretically the dependence of the approximation error in terms of the number of sensors (where the input function is defined) as well as the input function type, and we verify the theorem with computational results. More importantly, we observe high-order error convergence in our computational tests, namely polynomial rates (from half order to fourth order) and even exponential convergence with respect to the training dataset size.","Lu Lu, Pengzhan Jin, George Em Karniadakis"

This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver's solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.","Akshay Agrawal, Brandon Amos, Shane Barratt, Stephen Boyd, Steven Diamond, Zico Kolter"

In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations.   NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides.   This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field.   Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions).   Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation).

Motivated by an observation that the hidden layers of many existing deep sequence models converge towards some fixed point, we propose the DEQ approach that directly finds these equilibrium points via root-finding. Such a method is equivalent to running an infinite depth (weight-tied) feedforward network, but has the notable advantage that we can analytically backpropagate through the equilibrium point using implicit differentiation. Using this approach, training and prediction in these networks require only constant memory, regardless of the effective ""depth"" of the network. We demonstrate how DEQs can be applied to two state-of-the-art deep sequence models: self-attention transformers and trellis networks. On large-scale language modeling tasks, such as the WikiText-103 benchmark, we show that DEQs 1) often improve performance over these state-of-the-art models (for similar parameter counts); 2) have similar computational requirements to existing models; and 3) vastly reduce memory consumption (often the bottleneck for training large sequence models), demonstrating an up-to 88% memory reduction in our experiments.

The possibility of such `deleveraging spirals' was first predicted in the initial release of our paper in 2019 and later directly observed during the `Black Thursday' crisis in Dai in 2020. From these insights, we suggest design improvements that aim to improve long-term stability. We also introduce new attacks that exploit arbitrage-like opportunities around stablecoin liquidations. Using our model, we demonstrate that these can be profitable. These attacks may induce volatility in the `stable' asset and cause perverse incentives for miners, posing risks to blockchain consensus. A variant of such attacks also later occurred during Black Thursday, taking the form of mempool manipulation to clear Dai liquidation auctions at near zero prices, costing $8m.","Ariah Klages-Mundt, Andreea Minca"

The flexibility of our framework permits any basic GNN layer (e.g. convolutional or attentional) as the coupling function, from which a multi-layer deep neural network is built up via the dynamics of the proposed ODEs. We relate the oversmoothing problem, commonly encountered in GNNs, to the stability of steady states of the underlying ODE and show that zero-Dirichlet energy steady states are not stable for our proposed ODEs.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a graph with a trivial underlying sheaf. This choice is reflected in the structure of the graph Laplacian operator, the properties of the associated diffusion equation, and the characteristics of the convolutional models that discretise this equation. In this paper, we use cellular sheaf theory to show that the underlying geometry of the graph is deeply linked with the performance of GNNs in heterophilic settings and their oversmoothing behaviour. By considering a hierarchy of increasingly general sheaves, we study how the ability of the sheaf diffusion process to achieve linear separation of the classes in the infinite time limit expands. At the same time, we prove that when the sheaf is non-trivial, discretised parametric diffusion processes have greater control than GNNs over their asymptotic behaviour. On the practical side, we study how sheaves can be learned from data. The resulting sheaf diffusion models have many desirable properties that address the limitations of classical graph diffusion equations (and corresponding GNN models) and obtain competitive results in heterophilic settings. Overall, our work provides new connections between GNNs and algebraic topology and would be of interest to both fields.","Cristian Bodnar, Francesco Di Giovanni, Benjamin Paul Chamberlain, Pietro Liò, Michael M.

However, most of these methods adopt the standard point-wise self-attention mechanism, which not only becomes intractable for long-term forecasting since its complexity increases quadratically with the length of time series, but also cannot explicitly capture the predictive dependencies from contexts since the corresponding key and value are transformed from the same point. This paper proposes a predictive Transformer-based model called {\em Preformer}. Preformer introduces a novel efficient {\em Multi-Scale Segment-Correlation} mechanism that divides time series into segments and utilizes segment-wise correlation-based attention for encoding time series. A multi-scale structure is developed to aggregate dependencies at different temporal scales and facilitate the selection of segment length. Preformer further designs a predictive paradigm for decoding, where the key and value come from two successive segments rather than the same segment. In this way, if a key segment has a high correlation score with the query segment, its successive segment contributes more to the prediction of the query segment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Preformer outperforms other Transformer-based methods.","Dazhao Du, Bing Su, Zhewei Wei"

A striking consequence is that a regularization of the relative entropy is in fact an RG monotone. We compute this monotone in several examples. Our results apply more broadly to other exact renormalization group flow equations, including widely used specializations of Wegner-Morris flow. Moreover, our optimal transport framework for RG allows us to reformulate RG flow as a variational problem.

We define shape and temporal similarities and dissimilarities, based on a smooth relaxation of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Temporal Distortion Index (TDI), that enable to build differentiable loss functions and positive semi-definite (PSD) kernels. With these tools, we introduce DILATE (DIstortion Loss including shApe and TimE), a new objective for deterministic forecasting, that explicitly incorporates two terms supporting precise shape and temporal change detection. For probabilistic forecasting, we introduce STRIPE++ (Shape and Time diverRsIty in Probabilistic forEcasting), a framework for providing a set of sharp and diverse forecasts, where the structured shape and time diversity is enforced with a determinantal point process (DPP) diversity loss.

Second, future financial regulation could attempt strengthening the financial system as a whole. This can be achieved by re-shaping the topology of financial networks. We use an agent-based model (ABM) of a financial system and the real economy to study and compare the consequences of these two options. By conducting three ""computer experiments"" with the ABM we find that re-shaping financial networks is more effective and efficient than reducing leverage.

We contribute the Elliptic Data Set, a time series graph of over 200K Bitcoin transactions (nodes), 234K directed payment flows (edges), and 166 node features, including ones based on non-public data; to our knowledge, this is the largest labelled transaction data set publicly available in any cryptocurrency. We share results from a binary classification task predicting illicit transactions using variations of Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), with GCN being of special interest as an emergent new method for capturing relational information. The results show the superiority of Random Forest (RF), but also invite algorithmic work to combine the respective powers of RF and graph methods. Lastly, we consider visualization for analysis and explainability, which is difficult given the size and dynamism of real-world transaction graphs, and we offer a simple prototype capable of navigating the graph and observing model performance on illicit activity over time. With this tutorial and data set, we hope to a) invite feedback in support of our ongoing inquiry, and b) inspire others to work on this societally important challenge.","Mark Weber, Giacomo Domeniconi, Jie Chen, Daniel Karl I.

Despite the remarkable success of dataframe libraries in Rand Python, dataframes face performance issues even on moderately large datasets. Moreover, there is significant ambiguity regarding dataframe semantics. In this paper we lay out a vision and roadmap for scalable dataframe systems. To demonstrate the potential in this area, we report on our experience building MODIN, a scaled-up implementation of the most widely-used and complex dataframe API today, Python's pandas. With pandas as a reference, we propose a simple data model and algebra for dataframes to ground discussion in the field. Given this foundation, we lay out an agenda of open research opportunities where the distinct features of dataframes will require extending the state of the art in many dimensions of data management. We discuss the implications of signature data-frame features including flexible schemas, ordering, row/column equivalence, and data/metadata fluidity, as well as the piecemeal, trial-and-error-based approach to interacting with dataframes.","Devin Petersohn, Stephen Macke, Doris Xin, William Ma, Doris Lee, Xiangxi Mo, Joseph E.

Current generative models represent this manifold by mapping an $m$-dimensional latent variable through a neural network $f_\theta: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$. Such procedures, which we call pushforward models, incur a straightforward limitation: manifolds cannot in general be represented with a single parameterization, meaning that attempts to do so will incur either computational instability or the inability to learn probability densities within the manifold. To remedy this problem, we propose to model $\mathcal{M}$ as a neural implicit manifold: the set of zeros of a neural network. To learn the data distribution within $\mathcal{M}$, we introduce constrained energy-based models, which use a constrained variant of Langevin dynamics to train and sample within the learned manifold. The resulting model can be manipulated with an arithmetic of manifolds which allows practitioners to take unions and intersections of model manifolds. In experiments on synthetic and natural data, we show that constrained EBMs can learn manifold-supported distributions with complex topologies more accurately than pushforward models.","Brendan Leigh Ross, Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem, Anthony L.

JAX is based around pure functions and functional programming. PyTorch has popularised the use of an object-oriented (OO) class-based syntax for defining parameterised functions, such as neural networks. That this seems like a fundamental difference means current libraries for building parameterised functions in JAX have either rejected the OO approach entirely (Stax) or have introduced OO-to-functional transformations, multiple new abstractions, and been limited in the extent to which they integrate with JAX (Flax, Haiku, Objax). Either way this OO/functional difference has been a source of tension. Here, we introduce `Equinox', a small neural network library showing how a PyTorch-like class-based approach may be admitted without sacrificing JAX-like functional programming. We provide two main ideas. One: parameterised functions are themselves represented as `PyTrees', which means that the parameterisation of a function is transparent to the JAX framework. Two: we filter a PyTree to isolate just those components that should be treated when transforming (`jit', `grad' or `vmap'-ing) a higher-order function of a parameterised function -- such as a loss function applied to a model. Overall Equinox resolves the above tension without introducing any new programmatic abstractions: only PyTrees and transformations, just as with regular JAX.

We propose a new framework, Symbolic Functional Evolutionary Search (SyFES), that automatically constructs accurate functionals in the symbolic form, which is more explainable to humans, cheaper to evaluate, and easier to integrate to existing density functional theory codes than other ML functionals. We first show that without prior knowledge, SyFES reconstructed a known functional from scratch. We then demonstrate that evolving from an existing functional $\omega$B97M-V, SyFES found a new functional, GAS22 (Google Accelerated Science 22), that performs better for the majority of molecular types in the test set of Main Group Chemistry Database (MGCDB84).

One complication intrinsic to these models is finding a good sheaf for the task to be solved. Previous works proposed two diametrically opposed approaches: manually constructing the sheaf based on domain knowledge and learning the sheaf end-to-end using gradient-based methods. However, domain knowledge is often insufficient, while learning a sheaf could lead to overfitting and significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel way of computing sheaves drawing inspiration from Riemannian geometry: we leverage the manifold assumption to compute manifold-and-graph-aware orthogonal maps, which optimally align the tangent spaces of neighbouring data points. We show that this approach achieves promising results with less computational overhead when compared to previous SNN models.

A duality between the category of UMA representations and the category of the corresponding model spaces, extending the Sageev-Roller duality between discrete poc sets and discrete median algebras provides a two-way dictionary from inference to geometry, leading to immense savings in computation, at a cost in the quality of representation that can be quantified in terms of topological invariants. Moreover, the same framework naturally enables comparisons between different model spaces, making it possible to analyze the deficiencies of one model space in comparison to others. This paper develops the formalism underlying UMA, analyzes the complexity of maintenance and inference operations in UMA, and presents some learning guarantees for different UMA-based learners.

Because GATs use a static attention mechanism, there are simple graph problems that GAT cannot express: in a controlled problem, we show that static attention hinders GAT from even fitting the training data. To remove this limitation, we introduce a simple fix by modifying the order of operations and propose GATv2: a dynamic graph attention variant that is strictly more expressive than GAT. We perform an extensive evaluation and show that GATv2 outperforms GAT across 11 OGB and other benchmarks while we match their parametric costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/tech-srl/how_attentive_are_gats . GATv2 is available as part of the PyTorch Geometric library, the Deep Graph Library, and the TensorFlow GNN library.","Shaked Brody, Uri Alon, Eran Yahav"

We are primarily interested in score or rating-based cardinal data. From raw ranking data, we construct pairwise rankings, represented as edge flows on an appropriate graph. Our statistical ranking method uses the graph Helmholtzian, the graph theoretic analogue of the Helmholtz operator or vector Laplacian, in much the same way the graph Laplacian is an analogue of the Laplace operator or scalar Laplacian. We study the graph Helmholtzian using combinatorial Hodge theory: we show that every edge flow representing pairwise ranking can be resolved into two orthogonal components, a gradient flow that represents the L2-optimal global ranking and a divergence-free flow (cyclic) that measures the validity of the global ranking obtained -- if this is large, then the data does not have a meaningful global ranking. This divergence-free flow can be further decomposed orthogonally into a curl flow (locally cyclic) and a harmonic flow (locally acyclic but globally cyclic); these provides information on whether inconsistency arises locally or globally. An obvious advantage over the NP-hard Kemeny optimization is that discrete Hodge decomposition may be computed via a linear least squares regression. We also investigated the L1-projection of edge flows, showing that this is dual to correlation maximization over bounded divergence-free flows, and the L1-approximate sparse cyclic ranking, showing that this is dual to correlation maximization over bounded curl-free flows. We discuss relations with Kemeny optimization, Borda count, and Kendall-Smith consistency index from social choice theory and statistics.","Xiaoye Jiang, Lek-Heng Lim, Yuan Yao, Yinyu Ye"

This dichotomy should be reflected in the abstract as well. Without referring to the models directly -- only that a model consists of spaces and maps between them -- the most readily apparent feature of a multi-model system is its topology. We propose that this topology should be modeled first, and then the spaces and maps of the individual models be specified in accordance with the topology. Axiomatically, this construction leads to sheaves. Sheaf theory provides a toolbox for constructing predictive models described by systems of equations. Sheaves are mathematical objects that manage the combination of bits of local information into a consistent whole. The power of this approach is that complex models can be assembled from smaller, easier-to-construct models. The models discussed in this chapter span the study of continuous dynamical systems, partial differential equations, probabilistic graphical models, and discrete approximations of these models.",Michael Robinson

However, due to the quadratic runtime of the self-attention layers in Transformers, ViTs require the use of patch embeddings, which group together small regions of the image into single input features, in order to be applied to larger image sizes. This raises a question: Is the performance of ViTs due to the inherently-more-powerful Transformer architecture, or is it at least partly due to using patches as the input representation? In this paper, we present some evidence for the latter: specifically, we propose the ConvMixer, an extremely simple model that is similar in spirit to the ViT and the even-more-basic MLP-Mixer in that it operates directly on patches as input, separates the mixing of spatial and channel dimensions, and maintains equal size and resolution throughout the network. In contrast, however, the ConvMixer uses only standard convolutions to achieve the mixing steps. Despite its simplicity, we show that the ConvMixer outperforms the ViT, MLP-Mixer, and some of their variants for similar parameter counts and data set sizes, in addition to outperforming classical vision models such as the ResNet.

However, in practice, power series are not easy to compute. In this paper, we propose a new and more stable way to construct deep RePU neural networks based on Chebyshev polynomial approximations. By using a hierarchical structure of Chebyshev polynomial approximation in frequency domain, we build efficient and stable deep neural network constructions. In theory, ChebNets and the deep RePU nets based on Power series have the same upper error bounds for general function approximations. But numerically, ChebNets are much more stable. Numerical results show that the constructed ChebNets can be further trained and obtain much better results than those obtained by training deep RePU nets constructed basing on power series.","Shanshan Tang, Bo Li, Haijun Yu"

Our methodology is based on topological data analysis (TDA). We use persistence homology to detect and quantify topological patterns that appear in multidimensional time series. Using a sliding window, we extract time-dependent point cloud data sets, to which we associate a topological space. We detect transient loops that appear in this space, and we measure their persistence. This is encoded in real-valued functions referred to as a 'persistence landscapes'. We quantify the temporal changes in persistence landscapes via their $L^p$-norms. We test this procedure on multidimensional time series generated by various non-linear and non-equilibrium models. We find that, in the vicinity of financial meltdowns, the $L^p$-norms exhibit strong growth prior to the primary peak, which ascends during a crash. Remarkably, the average spectral density at low frequencies of the time series of $L^p$-norms of the persistence landscapes demonstrates a strong rising trend for 250 trading days prior to either dotcom crash on 03/10/2000, or to the Lehman bankruptcy on 09/15/2008.

Specifically, we show how persistent homology, a tool from TDA, can be used to yield a compressed, multi-scale representation of the graph that can distinguish between dynamic states such as periodic and chaotic behavior. We show the approach for two graph constructions obtained from the time series. In the first approach the time series is embedded into a point cloud which is then used to construct an undirected $k$-nearest neighbor graph. The second construct relies on the recently developed ordinal partition framework. In either case, a pairwise distance matrix is then calculated using the shortest path between the graph's nodes, and this matrix is utilized to define a filtration of a simplicial complex that enables tracking the changes in homology classes over the course of the filtration. These changes are summarized in a persistence diagram---a two-dimensional summary of changes in the topological features. We then extract existing as well as new geometric and entropy point summaries from the persistence diagram and compare to other commonly used network characteristics. Our results show that persistence-based point summaries yield a clearer distinction of the dynamic behavior and are more robust to noise than existing graph-based scores, especially when combined with ordinal graphs.","Audun Myers, Elizabeth Munch, Firas A.

In particular, we show that in graph convolutional models (GCN), the positive/negative eigenvalues of the channel mixing matrix correspond to attractive/repulsive forces between adjacent features. We rigorously prove how the channel-mixing can learn to steer the dynamics towards low or high frequencies, which allows to deal with heterophilic graphs. We show that the same class of energies is decreasing along a larger family of GNNs; albeit not gradient flows, they retain their inductive bias. We experimentally evaluate an instance of the gradient flow framework that is principled, more efficient than GCN, and achieves competitive performance on graph datasets of varying homophily often outperforming recent baselines specifically designed to target heterophily.","Francesco Di Giovanni, James Rowbottom, Benjamin P.

We then prove that optimizing a VDM boils down to learning a neural network to predict one of three potential objectives: the original source input from any arbitrary noisification of it, the original source noise from any arbitrarily noisified input, or the score function of a noisified input at any arbitrary noise level.

In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text.

One alternative is variational inference, where a candidate probability distribution is optimized to approximate the posterior distribution over unobserved variables. For good approximations, a flexible and highly expressive candidate distribution is desirable. In this work, we use quantum Born machines as variational distributions over discrete variables. We apply the framework of operator variational inference to achieve this goal. In particular, we adopt two specific realizations: one with an adversarial objective and one based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy.

However, has this alignment truly been demonstrated and theoretically quantified? Here we show, using methods from category theory and abstract algebra, that there exists an intricate connection between GNNs and DP, going well beyond the initial observations over individual algorithms such as Bellman-Ford.

Assuming asset prices are continuous and strictly positive, we derive model-free expressions for the funding rate and discount rate of these perpetual contracts as well as replication strategies for the short side. When asset prices can jump, we derive expressions for the funding and discount rates, which are semi-robust in the sense that they do not depend on the dynamics of the volatility process of the underlying risky assets, but do depend on the intensity of jumps under the market's pricing measure.

A foundation for multi-dimensional level-set persistent homology is laid via constructible cosheaves, which are equivalent to representations of MacPherson's entrance path category. By proving a van Kampen theorem, we give a direct proof of this equivalence. A cosheaf version of the i'th derived pushforward of the constant sheaf along a definable map is constructed directly as a representation of this category. We go on to clarify the relationship of cellular sheaves to cosheaves by providing a formula that defines a derived equivalence, which in turn recovers Verdier duality. Compactly-supported sheaf cohomology is expressed as the coend with the image of the constant sheaf through this equivalence. The equivalence is further used to establish relations between sheaf cohomology and a herein newly introduced theory of cellular sheaf homology. Inspired to provide fast algorithms for persistence, we prove that the derived category of cellular sheaves over a 1D cell complex is equivalent to a category of graded sheaves. Finally, we introduce the interleaving distance as an extended pseudo-metric on the category of sheaves. We prove that global sections partition the space of sheaves into connected components. We conclude with an investigation into the geometry of the space of constructible sheaves over the real line, which we relate to the bottleneck distance in persistence.",Justin Curry

These sheaf neural networks are based on the sheaf Laplacian, a generalization of the graph Laplacian that encodes additional relational structure parameterized by the underlying graph. The sheaf Laplacian and associated matrices provide an extended version of the diffusion operation in graph convolutional networks, providing a proper generalization for domains where relations between nodes are non-constant, asymmetric, and varying in dimension. We show that the resulting sheaf neural networks can outperform graph convolutional networks in domains where relations between nodes are asymmetric and signed.","Jakob Hansen, Thomas Gebhart"

Sequential decision-making requires reasoning about the possible future consequences of current behavior. Consequently, capturing the relationship between key evolving features for a given task is conducive to recovering effective policies. To this end, hyperbolic geometry provides deep RL models with a natural basis to precisely encode this inherently hierarchical information. However, applying existing methodologies from the hyperbolic deep learning literature leads to fatal optimization instabilities due to the non-stationarity and variance characterizing RL gradient estimators. Hence, we design a new general method that counteracts such optimization challenges and enables stable end-to-end learning with deep hyperbolic representations. We empirically validate our framework by applying it to popular on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms on the Procgen and Atari 100K benchmarks, attaining near universal performance and generalization benefits. Given its natural fit, we hope future RL research will consider hyperbolic representations as a standard tool.","Edoardo Cetin, Benjamin Chamberlain, Michael Bronstein, Jonathan J Hunt"

Both of these transforms are of interest for their mathematical properties as well as their applications to science and engineering, because they provide a way of summarizing shapes in a topological, yet quantitative, way. Both transforms take a shape, viewed as a tame subset $M$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and associates to each direction $v\in S^{d-1}$ a shape summary obtained by scanning $M$ in the direction $v$. These shape summaries are either persistence diagrams or piecewise constant integer-valued functions called Euler curves. By using an inversion theorem of Schapira, we show that both transforms are injective on the space of shapes, i.e.~each shape has a unique transform. Moreover, we prove that these transforms determine continuous maps from the sphere to the space of persistence diagrams, equipped with any Wasserstein $p$-distance, or the space of Euler curves, equipped with certain $L^p$ norms. By making use of a stratified space structure on the sphere, induced by hyperplane divisions, we prove additional uniqueness results in terms of distributions on the space of Euler curves. Finally, our main result proves that any shape in a certain uncountable space of PL embedded shapes with plausible geometric bounds can be uniquely determined using only finitely many directions.","Justin Curry, Sayan Mukherjee, Katharine Turner"

Viewing a convolution filter as a motif within an image, the persistence diagram of the resulting convolution describes the way the motif is distributed throughout that image. This pipeline, which we call convolutional persistence, extends the capacity of topology to observe patterns in image data. Indeed, we prove that (generically speaking) for any two images one can find some filter for which they produce different persistence diagrams, so that the collection of all possible convolutional persistence diagrams for a given image is an injective invariant. This is proven by showing convolutional persistence to be a special case of another topological invariant, the Persistent Homology Transform. Other advantages of convolutional persistence are improved stability and robustness to noise, greater flexibility for data-dependent vectorizations, and reduced computational complexity for convolutions with large stride vectors. Additionally, we have a suite of experiments showing that convolutions greatly improve the predictive power of persistence on a host of classification tasks, even if one uses random filters and vectorizes the resulting diagrams by recording only their total persistences.","Elchanan Solomon, Paul Bendich"

Recent results that build on fundamental work of Schapira have shown that this transform is injective, thus making the PHT a good summary object for each shape. Our homotopy sheaf result allows us to ""glue"" PHTs of different shapes together to build up the PHT of a larger shape. In the case where our shape is a polyhedron we prove a generalized nerve lemma for the PHT. Finally, by re-examining the sampling result of Smale-Niyogi-Weinberger, we show that we can reliably approximate the PHT of a manifold by a polyhedron up to arbitrary precision.","Shreya Arya, Justin Curry, Sayan Mukherjee"

We show that any fixed-precision transformer neural network can be translated into an equivalent fixed-size $\mathsf{FO}(\mathsf{M})$ formula, i.e., a first-order logic formula that, in addition to standard universal and existential quantifiers, may also contain majority-vote quantifiers. The proof idea is to design highly uniform boolean threshold circuits that can simulate transformers, and then leverage known theoretical connections between circuits and logic. Our results reveal a surprisingly simple formalism for capturing the behavior of transformers, show that simple problems like integer division are ""transformer-hard"", and provide valuable insights for comparing transformers to other models like RNNs. Our results suggest that first-order logic with majority may be a useful language for expressing programs extracted from transformers.","William Merrill, Ashish Sabharwal"

We show that minimizing the p-Wasserstein distance between the generator and the true data distribution is equivalent to the unconstrained min-min optimization of the p-Wasserstein distance between the encoder aggregated posterior and the prior in latent space, plus a reconstruction error. We also identify the role of its trade-off hyperparameter as the capacity of the generator: its Lipschitz constant. Moreover, we prove that optimizing the encoder over any class of universal approximators, such as deterministic neural networks, is enough to come arbitrarily close to the optimum. We therefore advertise this framework, which holds for any metric space and prior, as a sweet-spot of current generative autoencoding objectives. We then introduce the Sinkhorn auto-encoder (SAE), which approximates and minimizes the p-Wasserstein distance in latent space via backprogation through the Sinkhorn algorithm. SAE directly works on samples, i.e. it models the aggregated posterior as an implicit distribution, with no need for a reparameterization trick for gradients estimations. SAE is thus able to work with different metric spaces and priors with minimal adaptations. We demonstrate the flexibility of SAE on latent spaces with different geometries and priors and compare with other methods on benchmark data sets.","Giorgio Patrini, Rianne van den Berg, Patrick Forré, Marcello Carioni, Samarth Bhargav, Max Welling, Tim Genewein, Frank Nielsen"

However, have those methods truly moved beyond message passing? In this position paper, I argue about the dangers of using this term -- especially when teaching graph representation learning to newcomers. I show that any function of interest we want to compute over graphs can, in all likelihood, be expressed using pairwise message passing -- just over a potentially modified graph, and argue how most practical implementations subtly do this kind of trick anyway.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.","Tri Dao, Daniel Y.

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.","Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

Almost all the existing solutions for SBR model user preference only based on the current session without exploiting the other sessions, which may contain both relevant and irrelevant item-transitions to the current session. This paper proposes a novel approach, called Global Context Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (GCE-GNN) to exploit item transitions over all sessions in a more subtle manner for better inferring the user preference of the current session. Specifically, GCE-GNN learns two levels of item embeddings from session graph and global graph, respectively: (i) Session graph, which is to learn the session-level item embedding by modeling pairwise item-transitions within the current session; and (ii) Global graph, which is to learn the global-level item embedding by modeling pairwise item-transitions over all sessions. In GCE-GNN, we propose a novel global-level item representation learning layer, which employs a session-aware attention mechanism to recursively incorporate the neighbors' embeddings of each node on the global graph. We also design a session-level item representation learning layer, which employs a GNN on the session graph to learn session-level item embeddings within the current session. Moreover, GCE-GNN aggregates the learnt item representations in the two levels with a soft attention mechanism. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GCE-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods consistently.","Ziyang Wang, Wei Wei, Gao Cong, Xiao-Li Li, Xian-Ling Mao, Minghui Qiu"

In contrast with traditional games only having a single upfront fee to play, WoW also has a monthly subscription to play the game. With customer subscriptions in mind, we can apply the use of churn prediction to not only predict whether a customer will unsubscribe from the service but explore the user's playing behavior to obtain more insight into user playing patterns. The churn problem is somewhat complex due to the nature of not having a one size fits all solution, as different services define churn in a variety of ways. In this paper, we explore a dataset that focuses on one year from January 1, 2008, until December 31, 2008, as it highlights the release of a major content update in the game. Machine learning is used in two aspects of this paper: Survival Analysis and Binary Classification. Firstly, we explore the dataset using the Kaplan Meier estimator to predict the duration until a customer churns, and lastly predict whether a person will churn in six months using traditional machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN Classifier, and Random Forests. From the survival analysis results, WoW customers have a relatively long duration until churn, which solidifies the addictiveness of the game. Lastly, the binary classification performed in the best performing algorithm having a 96% ROC AUC score in predicting whether a customer will churn in six months.",Sulman Khan

To classify bots from normal users, detection methods are proposed in both game client and server-side. Among various classification methods, data mining method in server-side captured unique characteristics of bots efficiently. For features used in data mining, behavioral and social actions of character are analyzed with numerous algorithms. However, bot developers can evade the previous detection methods by changing bot's activities continuously. Eventually, overall maintenance cost increases because the selected features need to be updated along with the change of bot's behavior. To overcome this limitation, we propose improved bot detection method with financial analysis. As bot's activity absolutely necessitates the change of financial status, analyzing financial fluctuation effectively captures bots as a key feature. We trained and tested model with actual data of Aion, a leading MMORPG in Asia. Leveraging that LSTM efficiently recognizes time-series movement of data, we achieved meaningful detection performance. Further on this model, we expect sustainable bot detection system in the near future.","Kyung Ho Park, Eunjo Lee, Huy Kang Kim"

We studied the characteristics of exchanging virtual goods with real money through processes called ""real money trading (RMT)."" This exchange might influence online game user behaviors and cause damage to the reputation of game companies. We examined in-game transactions to reveal RMT by constructing a social graph of virtual goods exchanges in an online game and identifying network communities of users.   We analyzed approximately 6,000,000 transactions in a popular online game and inferred RMT transactions by comparing the RMT transactions crawled from an out-game market. Our findings are summarized as follows: (1) the size of the RMT market could be approximately estimated; (2) professional RMT providers typically form a specific network structure (either star-shape or chain) in the trading network, which can be used as a clue for tracing RMT transactions; and (3) the observed RMT market has evolved over time into a monopolized market with a small number of large-sized virtual goods providers.","Eunjo Lee, Jiyoung Woo, Hyoungshick Kim, Huy Kang Kim"

However, standard GNNs and the WL framework are inapplicable for geometric graphs embedded in Euclidean space, such as biomolecules, materials, and other physical systems. In this work, we propose a geometric version of the WL test (GWL) for discriminating geometric graphs while respecting the underlying physical symmetries: permutations, rotation, reflection, and translation. We use GWL to characterise the expressive power of geometric GNNs that are invariant or equivariant to physical symmetries in terms of distinguishing geometric graphs. GWL unpacks how key design choices influence geometric GNN expressivity: (1) Invariant layers have limited expressivity as they cannot distinguish one-hop identical geometric graphs; (2) Equivariant layers distinguish a larger class of graphs by propagating geometric information beyond local neighbourhoods; (3) Higher order tensors and scalarisation enable maximally powerful geometric GNNs; and (4) GWL's discrimination-based perspective is equivalent to universal approximation.
