    "* Via Nature News Briefing: [Ranking the effectiveness of worldwide COVID-19 government interventions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0) - looks very interesting, they use a range of models to fir change in R vs range of different interventions.  Methods include case-control analysis, Lasso, Random Forest, and Transformers\n",

Does compile for runtime versions 10 or 11 but no later (and those no ops are sent to TPU).  Check that it is using uint8 in model?  Ah, looks like int32 for the EdgeTPU on Pixel6 phones not EdgeTPU for coral.ai\n",
